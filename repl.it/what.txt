What do we look for in engineers?

We look for engineers that build their own tools,
have some experience in open-source software, and
care about developer tools or programming education.

We believe that at this moment in the history of
computing, a small team of programmers can build
world-changing platforms, tools, and products.
That's why we look for engineers that are
self-directed, understand what we're creating at a
visceral level, and are excited by our vision of the
future. We look for people that are not only excited
to deploy their skills at work but also their ideas,
dreams, and ambitions.
