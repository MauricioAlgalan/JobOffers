Our vision is to create a programming environment that blurs
the distinction between learning and building. A development
experience where the tedious setup and maintenance of the
environment is taken away and what's left is the programmer and
their creativity. This programming experience would be powered
by what we're calling a Holistic Development Service: an
always-on service that understands your code in all its stages,
A service that can be accessed anywhere you are regardless of
your device, platform, or programming language.

We are a small team with a passion for making programming
learnable, accessible, and usable. Amjad and Haya started
working on the idea that would become Repl.it back in 2011 and
by open-sourcing the underlining technology they helped launch
the learn-to-code movement. Amjad then joined Codecademy as a
founding engineer to make it easy for people to learn coding
online. Afterward, Amjad joined Facebook where he worked on
React Native and brought the same philosophy of fast iteration
and feedback loops (REPL) to mobile development.

In 2016, Haya and Amjad went back to working on Repl.it and
decided to take it from a side project to a company. Shortly
after Mason joined them and since then we've built our IDE,
our live-deployment container cloud, and our education platform.
So far we've touched so many lives with our technology --
millions of students around the world learned to code on our
platform, made tens of thousands of CS teachers more effective,
and empowered developers to build and share their creations with
the world.
