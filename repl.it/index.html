<h2 id="catching-up">Catching up</h2>
<p>Repl.it uses operational transformations to keep everyone in a multiplayer repl in sync. Don’t worry if you’ve never heard of or worked with operational transformations before; there are many variants and we’re going to define our own simple operations right here.</p>
<p>An operational transformation takes a document (you can think of it a string) plus a position within that document and either modifies the document at that position or skips to a new position. That’s it! Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>""</code>, position 0, <code>{"op": "insert", "chars": "Hello, human!"}</code> ➡️ <code>"Hello, human!"</code>, position 13</li>
<li><code>"What is up?"</code>, position 7, <code>{"op": "delete", "count": 3}</code> ➡️ <code>"What is?"</code>, position 7</li>
<li><code>"Nice!"</code>, position 0, <code>{"op": "skip", "count": 4}</code>, <code>{"op": "insert", "chars": " day"}</code> ➡️ <code>"Nice day!"</code>, position 9</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to watch out for is that you can’t skip or delete past the end of the string.</p>
<p>Now, back to keeping everyone in a multiplayer repl in sync. We often have to ask a client to catch up to the current state of the repl. When catching up, it’s important to validate that a sequence of operational transformations does indeed produce the most recent version of a file. You’re going to write the validation function. The function will take in a string for the stale file contents, a string containing the latest file contents, and a JSON string containing the operations. You may use any language! Here are some examples in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>function isValid(stale, latest, otjson) {
  // this is the part you will write!
}

isValid(
  &#39;Repl.it uses operational transformations to keep everyone in a multiplayer repl in sync.&#39;,

  &#39;[{&quot;op&quot;: &quot;skip&quot;, &quot;count&quot;: 40}, {&quot;op&quot;: &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;count&quot;: 47}]&#39;
); // true

); // false, delete past end
